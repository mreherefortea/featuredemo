# Part I: Familiarizing Yourself With the Instructions, Resources, and Help Tabs.  


>[!knowledge] By default, there are three sections (tabs) in the user interface:
>
> 1. **Instructions**
>
> 1. **Resources**
>
> 1. **Help**
> 
> !IMAGE[Example](threetabs.PNG){175}


1. **Instructions** contain the directional guidance for the end-user. Directional steps, videos, images, lab tokens, and external resources can be utilized in this section.  

1. **Resources** contains the virtual machines, removable media, network adapters, ability to load files to the running instance (for developers), send a @lab.CtrlAltDelete command to the virtual machine, the **Type Text** ability for the **Username** and **Password**, as well as the handy **Open in new window** feature. 

1. Below is an explanation of each feature:

  1. **Virtual Machines**: Here the end-user can interact with the different virtual machines in a multitude of ways, depending on what features may or may not be enabled by the **Lab developer**.
  
        >[!knowledge] If the **Lab Networks** are made visible to the end-user, the end-user can select which **Network adapter** the virtual machine utilizes. An example is shown in the first virtual machine in this lab:  !IMAGE[Example](Network.PNG){95}

  1. **Type Text**: This is a feature that allows the end-user to type pre-determined text with a single mouse click.  This is not only convenient for the end-user but eliminates user error, allowing the end-user to focus on the core of the material and not their typing accuracy.

  1. **Open in new window**:  Need to view two virtual machines side by side? No problem with this handy feature!

        >[!knowledge] To return to a single window, the user can simply close the new window. 

  1. **Removable Media**: This is where ISO's that are attached to the lab profile, can be selected by the end-user for use in their lab instance.   
 

  1. **Load Files**: This is where **Lab developers** can directly load an external file to the running lab environment (instance).


1. **Help**: Contains critical information for the support team and aesthetic options for the end-user. The following are some of the options found under **Help**:
  1. **Theme**:  Allows the user to change the color scheme of their environment. 
  1. **Support Information**: Provides the **Lab Instance ID**, a unique identifier that allows the exact running instance to be found, as well as, the datacenter the lab is running from and the specific host in said datacenter. 
  1. **Lab Interface FAQ**: Links the end-user to help center articles that address questions commonly asked by our end-users. 
  1. **Submit a Support Request**:  Takes the end-user to Learn on Demand System's support page, where a support ticket can be opened.

# Part II: Familiarizing Yourself With the Commands, Display, and Developer Functions


1. The **Commands** function allows for the user to send a @lab.CtrlAltDelete command to the virtual machine, use the **Type Text** feature outside of the **Instructions** and to either **Pause**, **Reset/Reboot**, **Turn Off** the virtual machine.

    >[!knowledge] If the **Lab Developer** has enabled the ability to revert the virtual machine, from the **Commands** function the option to **Revert Machine** will appear. This will return the virtual machine back to the state that it launched.  

    >[!knowledge] The **Type Text** feature here allows for the user to take external text, copy/paste it in the **prompt** !IMAGE[Prompt](Prompt.PNG){105}, and with a click of **OK** have it typed for them in the virtual environment. !IMAGE[Example](TypeText.PNG)

1. The **Display** function allows the end-user to adjust the sizing of the windows (full screen, fit window to machine, fit machine to window), open in a new window (another location for this feature), and to reconnect to the environment (can be used if the end-user has a latency spike in their connection to the data-center).

1. The **Developer** function allows **Lab Developers** to save a difference disk, retaining changes made in the virtual environmnent for future lab launches.

# Part III: Additional Features 


1. The end-user can split the directions from the lab environment by clicking the **Hamburger** !IMAGE[Hamburger](hamburger.PNG){25} menu and choosing **Split  Windows**. 

  !IMAGE[splitdirections2.PNG](splitdirections2.PNG){550}

    >[!note] This feature is currently only available for **Chrome** and **Firefox** browsers.  The end-user can rejoin the **Instructions** to the lab environment by clicking the same **Hamburger** menu and choosing **Join windows**. 

1. If more than one virtual machine is associated with the **Lab Profile**, from the **Title Bar** the end-user can navigate between virtual environments. 

  !IMAGE[Example](Middlebar.PNG){275}

1. Close all browser windows and the lab will continue to run in the background.
